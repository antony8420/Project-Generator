## Employee Registration System

### Project Overview
The Employee Registration System is a web-based application that allows HR personnel and managers to manage employee information within an organization. The system will provide functionality to create, view, update, and delete employee records.

### Functional Requirements

#### User Management
1. System shall support user authentication and role-based access control
2. Three user roles: HR Admin, Manager, Employee
3. HR Admin can perform all operations
4. Manager can view and update employee information
5. Employee can view own profile and update limited information

#### Employee Data Management
1. **Employee Registration (Create)**
   - Collect personal information: Employee ID, Full Name, Email, Phone, Address
   - Collect job information: Department, Position, Salary, Start Date
   - Automated Employee ID generation
   - Required fields validation
   - Email format validation

2. **Employee Data Retrieval (Read)**
   - List all employees in a paginated table
   - Search employees by name, department, or employee ID
   - View detailed employee profile
   - Export employee list to CSV

3. **Employee Information Update (Update)**
   - Modify employee personal and job information
   - Change salary and position (HR Admin only)
   - Update contact information
   - Audit trail for all changes

4. **Employee Removal (Delete)**
   - Soft delete functionality (mark as inactive)
   - Archive employee records
   - Prevent accidental deletion

#### Department Management
1. Create and manage departments
2. Assign employees to departments
3. Department-based reporting and filtering

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
1. System shall handle up to 10,000 employee records
2. Page load time < 2 seconds
3. Search results returned within 500ms

#### Security
1. All data transmission over HTTPS
2. Password hashing and salting
3. Session management with auto-timeout
4. Data encryption at rest
5. Role-based access controls

#### Usability
1. Responsive design for desktop and mobile
2. Intuitive user interface with clear navigation
3. Form validation with helpful error messages
4. Search and filter capabilities
5. Bulk operations for efficient data management

#### Integration
1. API endpoints for external system integration
2. RESTful API design
3. JSON data format for API responses
4. OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Technical Requirements

#### Frontend
1. React with TypeScript
2. Responsive UI with Material-UI or Tailwind CSS
3. Client-side validation
4. Real-time search and filtering
5. Data visualization for reporting

#### Backend
1. Node.js with Express.js
2. TypeScript for type safety
3. RESTful API endpoints
4. Middleware for authentication and error handling
5. Input validation and sanitization

#### Database
1. JSON file-based storage for simplicity
2. Data persistence and retrieval
3. Backup and data integrity features

#### Deployment
1. Environment configuration (development/staging/production)
2. Continuous integration and deployment
3. Logging and monitoring
4. Error tracking and reporting

### User Stories

#### As an HR Admin, I want to:
1. Register new employees in the system
2. View all employee information
3. Update employee records when information changes
4. Deactivate employees when they leave
5. Generate reports on employee demographics

#### As a Manager, I want to:
1. View information of employees in my department
2. Update employee information within my authority
3. Send requests for employee data changes to HR

#### As an Employee, I want to:
1. View my personal information
2. Update my contact information and address
3. Change my password when required

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Employee Registration
- Given a new employee joins, when HR enters their information, then the system creates a unique employee ID and stores all data
- Given missing required information, when trying to save employee, then the system shows clear validation errors

#### Employee Search
- Given a list of employees, when HR searches by name, then relevant results are displayed
- Given employee records exist, when filtering by department, then only matching employees show

#### Data Update
- Given an employee record exists, when updating information, then changes are saved with username and timestamp
- Given role restrictions exist, when manager tries to change salary, then access is denied

### Out of Scope
1. Payroll processing
2. Benefits management
3. Time tracking and attendance
4. Performance reviews
5. Recruitment management

### Assumptions
1. Internet connectivity is available at all times
2. Users have basic computer literacy
3. Maximum 100 concurrent users
4. Data backup will be performed by IT team
5. No integration with existing HR systems required

### Constraints
1. Must use React + Node.js with TypeScript
2. No direct database access - use JSON file storage
3. Project must be completed within 4 weeks
4. Total budget not exceeding $50,000

### Risk Assessment
1. **Technical Risk**: Learning curve for TypeScript/React may delay development
2. **Security Risk**: Sensitive employee data must be properly secured
3. **Performance Risk**: Large datasets may slow system responsiveness
4. **Scope Risk**: Additional requirements may extend timeline

### Success Metrics
1. System handles employee registration within 5 minutes
2. Employee search returns results within 2 seconds
3. Zero data loss or corruption
4. User satisfaction rating above 90%
5. System availability 99.9%
